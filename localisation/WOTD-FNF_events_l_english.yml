Portraying them as noble beasts of the mountain, revered by the people of the Middle Kingdom. Empress Dowager Bo was said to have been buried clasping onto a panda skull.\n\nSo far we know the Panda's parts don't have any medical properties. Much to the dismay of our court physicians, which up till now have been forbidden from exploiting the beast, as the court's seers fear such actions might bring misfortune to our lands. \n\nAnother possibility, now that we have increased our influence over the western parts of our empire, might be to revive an age-old custom of sending pandas to our tributaries that are in our good graces; like Empress dowager Wu Zetian did when she gifted two of these beasts to Japan, cementing ties. Her reign and decisions helped revitalize China and its culture. But, as of recent, the "Dwarf to our East" has been growing ever bolder. As such our Ministry of Rites recommends we focus on our subjects that follow the Confucian ways."

Imposing as they are, the people of this island revere these savage beasts and go out of their way to not hurt them. After asking around we get told about the myth that surrounds animals:\n\n \"On Komodo Island lived a beautiful princess, called by the people;  ‘The Dragon Princess'. The Princess marries and gives birth to twins, one is a human boy called Gerong and the second is a female dragon, named Ora. Gerong took residence with the humans in the village and Ora turned to the forest. Years passed and the twins grew up into adults. One day, Gerong set out to hunt deer. He was successful and caught the deer and set about collecting it to take back to the people of the village. Suddenly, out of nowhere, appeared a large Komodo dragon which began feasting on the deer. Gerong tried to scare the dragon away, but it did not move, so he took out his bow and arrow and took aim. Suddenly there was a bright flash of light and a beautiful woman appeared. It was his mother, The Dragon Princess. \"Do not kill her,\" The Dragon Princess implored. \"That is your twin sister, Ora.\" Gerong put down his weapon and left the dragon in peace. From that point onwards, the people of Komodo Island lived harmoniously with the dragons and would not hunt or hurt them. The dragons could hunt freely on the island and when they were injured, their human brothers would come to their aid.\""

While they did share the island with giant eagles (Haast's Eagles), which too subsisted on the Moa birds,  they didn't pose a threat to their earlier ancestors who hunted down the Moa with spears and traps. \nIt has been some time since Moa have been sighted around the village and the time of Moa hunters is long gone. All villages in the vicinity now get their nourishment from farming and fishing. Some moved further inland, chasing the Moa.

Even so, after long deliberation we decided to let this man set out, even if it was only to be given reprieve from his squabbles. \n\nOn his journey through these American jungles it was then that this painter encountered a beast that enamoured him to the depths of his whimsical soul.

This animal seems to be adored by Europeans and locals alike.

But, I can not comply … as such, I named him Babou.\"\n\nThe painter has been caught smuggling his 'pet' onto our ship after our last expedition.

To show the earnestness behind their eagerness they've sent gifts in the form of an animal that hasn't stepped foot on this continent since the time of Theodosius. A beast first introduced by Julius Caesar who appropriately named it 'Camelopard'. This extraordinary animal is like a camel in all respects except that its legs are not all of the same length, the hind legs being the shorter. Beginning from the rump it grows gradually higher, which gives it the appearance of mounting some elevation; and towering high aloft, it supports the rest of its body on its front legs and lifts its neck in turn to an unusual height. Its skin is spotted like a leopard, and for this reason it bears the joint name of both animals.\n\nThe Ethiopians have gone through no small amount of trouble getting this animal to our court.

Such policies have worked in the neighbouring region of Bahia, but some fear that the dry climate of Sao Francisco might not be suitable for such an extreme undertaking. Instead, the local government requests monetary support to dig irrigation so they can support a wider array of crops. Also, it would leave most of the caatinga, the desiccant landscape removed from the river, untouched. A move that would still allow locals to forage and wildlife to fare well.
