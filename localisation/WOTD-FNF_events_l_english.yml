 wotd_fnf.001.desc:0 "During the golden age of the Tang dynasty, poets made sure to feature the Giant Panda, or Big Bear-Cat, in many of their works. Portraying them as noble beasts of the mountain, revered by the people of the Middle Kingdom. Empress Dowager Bo was said to have been buried clasping onto a panda skull.\n\nSo far we know the Panda’s parts don't have any medical properties. Much to the dismay of our court physicians, which up till now have been forbidden from exploiting the beast, as the court’s seers fear such actions might bring misfortune to our lands. \n\nAnother possibility, now that we have increased our influence over the western parts of our empire, might be to revive an age-old custom of sending pandas to our tributaries that are in our good graces; like Empress dowager Wu Zetian did when she gifted two of these beasts to Japan, cementing ties. Her reign and decisions helped revitalize China and its culture. But, as of recent, the “Dwarf to our East” has been growing ever bolder. As such our Ministry of Rites recommends we focus on our subjects that follow the Confucian ways."
 wotd_fnf.001.opta:0 "Like the idiom goes: \"If you observe no taboos, you will see gold covering the ground.\""
 wotd_fnf.001.optb:0 "The Dwarf knows its place. Right?"
 wotd_fnf.001.optc:0 "Joseon, our closest subject. The Seonbi will treat the animal with respect."
 wotd_fnf.001.optd:0 "Share the pandas among our loyal tributaries."
 wotd_fnf.001.opte:0 "Decide based on $MONARCH$’s preference of concubines."
 wotd_fnf.001.optf:0 "Panda diplomacy? That’s beneath us." 
 wotd_fnf.002.title:0 "Here be Dragons"
 wotd_fnf.002.desc:0 "The recently discovered island of Flores is home to a species of giant lizards, the so called \"Komodo dragons\". Adults can reach up to 3 meters in length, and with their powerful tail, large claws and serrated teeth; they have no trouble living up to their fearsome reputation. Imposing as they are, the people of this island revere these savage beasts and go out of their way to not hurt them. After asking around we get told about the myth that surrounds animals:\n\n \"On Komodo Island lived a beautiful princess, called by the people;  ‘The Dragon Princess’. The Princess marries and gives birth to twins, one is a human boy called Gerong and the second is a female dragon, named Ora. Gerong took residence with the humans in the village and Ora turned to the forest. Years passed and the twins grew up into adults. One day, Gerong set out to hunt deer. He was successful and caught the deer and set about collecting it to take back to the people of the village. Suddenly, out of nowhere, appeared a large Komodo dragon which began feasting on the deer. Gerong tried to scare the dragon away, but it did not move, so he took out his bow and arrow and took aim. Suddenly there was a bright flash of light and a beautiful woman appeared. It was his mother, The Dragon Princess. \"Do not kill her,\" The Dragon Princess implored. \"That is your twin sister, Ora.\" Gerong put down his weapon and left the dragon in peace. From that point onwards, the people of Komodo Island lived harmoniously with the dragons and would not hunt or hurt them. The dragons could hunt freely on the island and when they were injured, their human brothers would come to their aid.\""
 wotd_fnf.002.opta:0 "It sure would make for a fine trophy."
 wotd_fnf.002.optb:0 "A truly inhospitable area."
 wotd_fnf.002.optc:0 "True to our heritage."
 wotd_fnf.002.optd:0 "Tell them God created these giant lizards."
