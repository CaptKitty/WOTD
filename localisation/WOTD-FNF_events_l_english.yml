 wotd_fnf.001.desc:0 "During the golden age of the Tang dynasty, poets made sure to feature the Giant Panda, or Big Bear-Cat, in many of their works. Portraying them as noble beasts of the mountain, revered by the people of the Middle Kingdom. Empress Dowager Bo was said to have been buried clasping onto a panda skull.\n\nSo far we know the Panda's parts don't have any medical properties. Much to the dismay of our court physicians, which up till now have been forbidden from exploiting the beast, as the court's seers fear such actions might bring misfortune to our lands. \n\nAnother possibility, now that we have increased our influence over the western parts of our empire, might be to revive an age-old custom of sending pandas to our tributaries that are in our good graces; like Empress dowager Wu Zetian did when she gifted two of these beasts to Japan, cementing ties. Her reign and decisions helped revitalize China and its culture. But, as of recent, the "Dwarf to our East" has been growing ever bolder. As such our Ministry of Rites recommends we focus on our subjects that follow the Confucian ways."

 wotd_fnf.002.desc:0 "The recently discovered island of Flores is home to a species of giant lizards, the so called \"Komodo dragons\". Adults can reach up to 3 meters in length, and with their powerful tail, large claws and serrated teeth; they have no trouble living up to their fearsome reputation. Imposing as they are, the people of this island revere these savage beasts and go out of their way to not hurt them. After asking around we get told about the myth that surrounds animals:\n\n \"On Komodo Island lived a beautiful princess, called by the people;  ‘The Dragon Princess'. The Princess marries and gives birth to twins, one is a human boy called Gerong and the second is a female dragon, named Ora. Gerong took residence with the humans in the village and Ora turned to the forest. Years passed and the twins grew up into adults. One day, Gerong set out to hunt deer. He was successful and caught the deer and set about collecting it to take back to the people of the village. Suddenly, out of nowhere, appeared a large Komodo dragon which began feasting on the deer. Gerong tried to scare the dragon away, but it did not move, so he took out his bow and arrow and took aim. Suddenly there was a bright flash of light and a beautiful woman appeared. It was his mother, The Dragon Princess. \"Do not kill her,\" The Dragon Princess implored. \"That is your twin sister, Ora.\" Gerong put down his weapon and left the dragon in peace. From that point onwards, the people of Komodo Island lived harmoniously with the dragons and would not hunt or hurt them. The dragons could hunt freely on the island and when they were injured, their human brothers would come to their aid.\""

 wotd_fnf.003.desc:0 "A lack of food in the adjacent regions has pushed a horde of Mandrill Monkeys into the cassava fields of our farmers.  Cassava, originally from the Americas, has quickly become a staple crop on the African continent since its introduction. While our food supply in the region up till now has been relatively safe from these belligerent bandits, the scarcity of fruit in the region has forced them to dig up the soil and raid our provisions. Worst of all they've gotten a craving for peanuts, another import from the Americas, and our seed reserves have all but run dry. \n\nIn the face of this catastrophe our farmers are helpless. Mandrill Monkeys move around in troops of over a thousand individuals, and will attack en masse when disturbed. By the time our militia is able to react the fields have long been raided and the horde has long since moved on to raid other fields."

 wotd_fnf.004.desc:0 "When the first generations of Maori touched down on these lands, they had known nothing but plenty. It was then when the Moa Hunter period began during which the Polynesians made their first contact with the Moa, of which the traditional name, still used by some village elders, is the ‘te kura' (the red bird), a large struthious bird which supplied them with abundance of food. While they did share the island with giant eagles (Haast's Eagles), which too subsisted on the Moa birds,  they didn't pose a threat to their earlier ancestors who hunted down the Moa with spears and traps. \nIt has been some time since Moa have been sighted around the village and the time of Moa hunters is long gone. All villages in the vicinity now get their nourishment from farming and fishing. Some moved further inland, chasing the Moa. But, as the saying goes:\n\n\"Te toto o te tangata, he kai; te oranga o te tangata, he whenua.\" \n\"The blood of man's body is formed from his food; it is land which grows that food to sustain him.\"\n\nWhile this coastal village no longer hunts for Moa, it is known some of the inland tribes have continued the traditions and often come to this village with trinkets made from Moa bone and feather to trade.That being said; the original purpose of our journey was to map Terra Australis Incognita and make observations of the Magellanic clouds. But, some of our accompanying cartographers want to venture out in search of these astronomic birds."

 wotd_fnf.005.desc:0 "For years, one of the painters at our court has been imploring our liege to allow him to set out for our colonies in central-America, on the government's budget, of course, to enhance his craft. It has been long understood by our other advisors that this man has an adventurous spirit, some might even call it a "death wish". Even so, after long deliberation we decided to let this man set out, even if it was only to be given reprieve from his squabbles. \n\nOn his journey through these American jungles it was then that this painter encountered a beast that enamoured him to the depths of his whimsical soul. His journal reads as follows: \n\n\"Look at his little spots, those tufted ears. The animal has the most wonderful tangle of stripes, bars, chains, spots, dots, smudges … which look as though they were put on as the animal ran by. This animal seems to be adored by Europeans and locals alike. And, it seems, that one of them on our journey has gotten quite brazen as he seemingly has no issue with being fed from the hands of men … The captain has ordered us not to interact with the animal, for our supplies are precious. But, I can not comply … as such, I named him Babou.\"\n\nThe painter has been caught smuggling his 'pet' onto our ship after our last expedition. The captain is all but amused, and has demanded the thing be left behind, or better yet, sold off. "

 wotd_fnf.006.desc:0 "The first years in our new colony of $PROVINCE$ have been rough. Not only have our attempts to get the local population to work on our spice plantations been met with hostilities, but now even our cook has gone missing.\n\nLocals say they were kidnapped by an Orangutan, or 'person of the forest' as it's otherwise known as. A large ape which spends most of its time solitary in these forest's canopy. The natives believe the ape can talk, lest he be compelled to labour. And thus it has been taboo to hunt these great apes due to their great likeness to man.\n\nOur colonists aren't too sure as to whether they want to put the blame on the Orangutans, seeing as they have helped them find caches of honey and edible fruits when supplies were running low, and so far these beasts have been nothing but amicable, albeit a bit shy. \n\nIf we do want to give this plan the go-ahead; the locals from a rival tribe might be willing to assist us in our hunt. But, this might spark some conflict in the region."

Which the natives took as a good omen. The bird and the people that called this island their home would soon regret the songs and gifts they provided to these strangers from far away lands, as both would see their demise the next time these visitors embarked on their island."

 wotd_fnf.008.desc:0 "Our captain sent his crew to the Australian coast to shoot pigeons to make stew for the sick people on board. When the crew returned, they told us that they had seen an animal that was as big as a greyhound, mouse grey and capering across the place. A few days passed and our captain, pressed on by the on-board naturalist, went ashore heading off on excursion in search of this beast. Our captain writes: \"After a march of many miles they discovered four similar animals, of which two were chased by our greyhounds. The animals escaped by leaps and bounds in the thick, tall brush, not to be seen again. A truly odd sight. These creatures do not walk on four legs, but launch themselves forward like a jumping mouse on their hind legs. When we asked the locals they replied with the word 'Kangaroo'. Such a fascinating beast.\"\n\nOn further observation, though, the natives kept saying 'Kangaroo' even in reply to questions that had nothing to do with the animal. Are we sure we understood them correctly?"

In other regions its hide is fabricated into a decorative headpiece as a sign of good luck,  traditionally worn by both bride and bridegroom.\n\nNow that we're trying to bridge the gap and mend relations with our southern neighbours through a policy of Heqin. Maybe it's time that we familiarize ourselves with the traditions of our Southern subjects. Hopefully, by employing the hides of these animals, we further establish our image as a benevolent empire not seeking to expand through militaristic means."

 wotd_fnf.010.desc:0 "Ever since the fall of the Roman Empire and the subsequent muslim conquest of Eqypt, the Empire of Aksum, now Ethiopia, has remained relatively isolated from the larger Christian world. The once proud nation of Aksum was the gateway for both African and Indian goods to reach Europe, all due their unique location along the Red Sea.\n\nThe Ethiopians seem eager to warm relations, a wish they've made known ever since the first Ethiopian monks from the Jerusalem community attended the Council of Florence in 1441 at the invitation of the pope, who was seeking to reunite the Eastern and Western churches. To show the earnestness behind their eagerness they've sent gifts in the form of an animal that hasn't stepped foot on this continent since the time of Theodosius. A beast first introduced by Julius Caesar who appropriately named it 'Camelopard'. This extraordinary animal is like a camel in all respects except that its legs are not all of the same length, the hind legs being the shorter. Beginning from the rump it grows gradually higher, which gives it the appearance of mounting some elevation; and towering high aloft, it supports the rest of its body on its front legs and lifts its neck in turn to an unusual height. Its skin is spotted like a leopard, and for this reason it bears the joint name of both animals.\n\nThe Ethiopians have gone through no small amount of trouble getting this animal to our court. Maybe it's time to actively pursue relations with our Coptic brothers?"

Such policies have worked in the neighbouring region of Bahia, but some fear that the dry climate of Sao Francisco might not be suitable for such an extreme undertaking. Instead, the local government requests monetary support to dig irrigation so they can support a wider array of crops. Also, it would leave most of the caatinga, the desiccant landscape removed from the river, untouched. A move that would still allow locals to forage and wildlife to fare well. Which might prove profitable in the long run, as the region is home to an azure blue species of Macaw, prized for its feathers."

As a result the party decided to kill the birds and add it to the stew. Sadly, to your party’s dismay the bird is not suited for consumption. Its meat , even when cooked, maintains its manure-like stench. And after many attempts for possible recipes the party has given up any outlook of consuming this most foul of birds.\n\nMaybe its stench is derived from its seemingly plant-based diet?"
